# The Three Musketeers #
This project is a Java recreation of the classic strategy game of Three Musketeers, played in the terminal.

Some features in this project were used to test out certain design patterns, even though the features themselves could be implemented in simpler ways. In short, they were used to help develop my understanding of OOP and its various design patterns. These patterns are:
- Command Pattern (Registering Players)
- Iterator Pattern (Replay System)
- Strategy Pattern (Hint/Assistance System)
- Observer Pattern (Player Ranking System)
- Memento Pattern (Game Reset Feature)
- Builder Pattern (Custom Board Builder Feature)

## Playing the Game ##
Note that this project was originally built in the Eclipse IDE, and may not play properly in other IDEs.

To start the game, simply run the code found in "./src/threeMusketeers/ThreeMusketeers.java".
